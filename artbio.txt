Musician and composer Tsz Kiu Pang (he/him/they/them; *1992) was born and raised in Hong Kong, and came to Australia in 2012. His music concerns the large-scale manipulation of time and space, and reflects the struggle of his depression. Being a musician and an electrical engineer, Pang often incorporates improvisation and computer programming in his music. Pang has performed throughout Australia including at the Melbourne International Jazz Festival and the Museum of Old and New Art.  His most recent endevour is using the open source software Abjad to create complexly notated music algorithmically, with every note generated and notated by the computer. Pang is also collaborating with the authors of Abjad to improve and maintain the software for interested composers.  

My development time will be spent doing one or both of the followings:
1.  Preparing a workshop for people who are interested in algorithmic composition, showcasing the possibility of using Abjad to compose notated music across a number of genres.
2.  Composing a new piece of notated music using Abjad, which includes computer programming and rehearsal with an associate performing musician.

At the end of my residency, I will hold a workshop for people who are interested in algorithmic composition. The workshop will focus on sharing with the audience how to compose music using Abjad. I would encourage the audience to bring their laptops so that we can have a group programming session. At the end of the workshop, my associate musician would perform a piece written using Abjad, to showcase the musical possibilities of computer programming.
