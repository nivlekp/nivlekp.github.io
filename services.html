        <h2>Composition Lessons (100 AUD per hour)</h2>
        <p>
            I offer composition lessons in a unique way. Being trained in
            classical piano and composition at a university level, I am
            familiar with many genres. I also have strong knowledge of both
            classical and jazz music theory.
        </p>

        <p>
            As an electrical engineering graduate, I incorporate my skills in
            engineering and programming into my artistic practice. I have two
            years of experience in tutoring programming at a university level.
            Therefore, my composition lessons could also empower students to
            integrate computing into their composition toolset if they are
            interested.
        </p>

        <p>
            I am an active contributor to the algorithmic composition software

            <a href="https://abjad.github.io/">Abjad</a>

            and the maintainer of its rhythmic quantizer extension

            <a href="https://abjad.github.io/api/abjadext/nauert/index.html">Abjad-ext-nauert</a>.

            I teach students how to utilise

            <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a>
            (a general-purposed programming language),

            <a href="https://lilypond.org/">LilyPond</a>
            (which means they don't have to pay for Sibelius or Finale ever
            again!) and

            <a href="https://abjad.github.io/">Abjad</a>

            into their composition.
        </p>

            <a href="https://github.com/nivlekp/utsu/blob/main/utsu/builds/score/utsu.pdf">utsu</a>,

            which was generated entirely using Abjad and Python.

            cost). Please feel free to
