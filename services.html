        <h2>Composition Lessons (100 AUD per hour)</h2>
        <p>
            I offer composition lessons in a very unique way. Being trained in
            classical piano and composition at a university level, I have
            acquired a sophisticated taste in music, as well as strong
            knowledge in both classical and jazz music theory. I am also
            utilising my skills in engineering and programming in my
            composition practice. Having tutored programming at a university
            level for two years, I can teach you how to program in Python (a
            general-purpose programming language). And being an active
            contributor of the algorithmic composition software Abjad, I can
            teach you how to utilise Python, LilyPond (which means you don't
            have to pay for Sibelius or Finale ever again!) and Abjad into your
            composition.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am offering individual lessons over Zoom anywhere in the world,
            and in-person lessons around Melbourne, Victoria (with travel
            cost).
