            <p>
            Musician and composer Tsz Kiu Pang (he/him/they/them; *1992) was
            born and raised in Hong Kong, and came to Australia in 2012. His
            music concerns the large-scale manipulation of time and space, and
            reflects the struggle of his depression. Being a musician and an
            electrical engineer, Pang often incorporates improvisation and
            computer programming in his music. Pang has performed throughout
            Australia including at the Melbourne International Jazz Festival
            and the Museum of Old and New Art.  His most recent endeavour is
            using the open source software Abjad to create complexly notated
            music algorithmically, with every note generated and notated by the
            computer. Pang is also collaborating with the authors of Abjad to
            improve and maintain the software for interested composers.
